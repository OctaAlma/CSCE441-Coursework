To run the assignments, I require the following libraries:
 - GLEW
 - GLM
 - GLFW

To compile a specific assignment:
 - Go into the assignment folder
 - Make a new directory called "build"
 - Go inside the build directory
 - Call the command "cmake .."
 - Compile with "make -j4"
 - Run with ./A# <...ARGS...>
