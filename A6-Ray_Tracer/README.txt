I completed all of the tasks.
I also implemented the bonus for motion blur and the bonus for ray tracing + blinn-phong.

To run the code, use the command specified in the instructions:
./A6 <SCENE NO> <RESOLUTION> <OUTPUT FILE NAME>

To run the bonus, pass 9 as the scene number argument.

If you want to render the multiple frames for motion blur:
 - Go to main.cpp and uncomment line 121
 - Create a folder called "frames" in the same directory as the src and resources folders.
 - Compile and run normally
 - 45 frame images should appear in the frames directory.

Note: since motion blur involves rendering a scene multiple times, it will take longer than the other tasks. I have included a GIF showcasing all 45 frames produced in a 1024x1024 resolution.
